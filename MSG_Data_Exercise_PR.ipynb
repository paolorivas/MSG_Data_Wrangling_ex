However, because of the nature of this dataset and its lenght, this approach would do more harm than good. \n",

This would be valid if we only had to transform a truly small amount of values (no more than 3). Otherwise, that is extremely time consuming and not practical. From a coding perspective, a disaster. \n",

However, my approach is asumming that any transaction that does not match school name, date of financing and School ID is not the same transaction, even though the loan number is the same. It is my understanding that it could be the case that a same amount could be given to a same institution in different moments. For that reason,and the lack of more information, I decided to proceed like previously explained. However, this could bring some limitations to the accuracy of the final summary table numbers.\n"
